## Project Overview

This repository enacts a paradigmatic intervention into the algorithmic
conditions of knowledge production. By deploying brute-force combinatorics
across intersecting wordlists, the *Feminist Study Generator* destabilizes
traditional notions of authorship, originality, and labor.

Whereas human academics require grants, tenure committees, and sabbaticals
to generate a mere handful of publications, this machine produces **9.126 million
quality research project titles in under a minute** — a rate that no human(ities)
University department can possibly rival.

### Objectives

1. **Foreground Repetition as Methodology**
   Repetition is not failure, but rather a radical critique of originality
   and a destabilization of linear temporality.

2. **De-center Authorial Intentionality**
   The generator decenters the “scholar” by rendering all scholarship
   equivalent to brute-force recombination.

3. **Operationalize Epistemic Violence**
   In its relentless productivity, the generator reveals the violence inherent
   in academia’s valorization of output over meaning.

---

## Significance

The *Feminist Study Generator* must be understood not merely as a piece of
Python code, but as a performative act of resistance against the neoliberal
knowledge economy. By producing millions of titles that are **simultaneously
stunning, brave, and stunning**, it both fulfills and parodies the metrics of
academic productivity.

## Keywords
*algorithmic hauntology, brute-force epistemologies, queer imaginaries,
posthuman assemblages, tenure satanics, citation necropolitics, radical textuality*

## Acknowledgments

This project was generously **not funded** by the European Research Council,
the Finnish Academy of Sciences, or any other institution that might
legitimately have stopped it. All computational resources were stolen
from a neglected university server room, and the author gratefully
acknowledges the unpaid emotional labor of graduate students everywhere.
